The files in this "rootfs" directory will be included in a tar file, linked to the build and un-tarred in the RAM disk on startup.
This allows you to pre-populate a RAM disk on a platform that does not have a working SD card or flash memory file system.
The files and directories are placeholders for an eventual core Flight System (cFS) port, but any files or directories should work.
